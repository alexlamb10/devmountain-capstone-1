Trip Planner

With the tirp planner you are able to add various trips onto your profile for places that you may want 
to visit at some point. After creating your account and logging in you are taken to a screen where you
will add these trips. You can then navigate to other pages to view your trips you have added, as well as
previous trips. In order to add a previous trip you add it as you would any other trip, then you go to 
the trip wishlist page where you'll see a "MArk as Complete" button. This will move the trip to the next
page which holds previous trips, where you can add a picture from the trip to be stored as well.
